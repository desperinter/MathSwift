MathSwift
=========
# Overview
MathSwift is an iOS Dynamic Framework written in Swift which supports complex mathmatical operations. Currently it mainly support matrix and some advanced linear  algrbra operations such as singular value decomposition. It may also serve as a demostration of good practice for developing iOS/OSX dynamic frameworks in pure Swift, including a complete set of unit tests.

This is a version of MathSwift framework written by <i><b> huangenyan </b></i>. In this version, some syntax errors have been fixed to adapt to Swift 3 as well as many methods have been tested carefully and refine. Furthermore, I added some functions based on Numerical Linear Algebra algorithms such as QR decomposition, Cholesky's factorization, least square solution, etc.
